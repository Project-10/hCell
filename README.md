hCell is a C++ library, which allows representing raster images via hexagonical picture elements instead of classical quadratic ones. This leads to hexagonical neighbourhood system, where each pixture element has 6 equidistant neighbours. Such neighbourhood system finds its application in computer vision and pattern recognition problems. Also, the library is well suited for creating artistic photo manipulation effects.
